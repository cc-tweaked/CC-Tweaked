      Description of the bug. Please include the following:
      - Logs: These will be located in the `logs/` directory of your Minecraft
        instance. Please upload them as a gist or directly into this editor.
      - Detailed reproduction steps: sometimes I can spot a bug pretty easily,
        but often it's much more obscure. The more information I have to help
        reproduce it, the quicker it'll get fixed.
