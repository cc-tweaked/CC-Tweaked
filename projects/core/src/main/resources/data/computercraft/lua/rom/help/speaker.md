The speaker program plays audio files using speakers attached to this computer.

It supports audio files in a limited number of formats:
* DFPWM: You can convert music to DFPWM with external tools like https://music.madefor.cc.
* WAV: WAV files must be 8-bit PCM or DFPWM, with exactly one channel and a sample rate of 48kHz.

## Examples:
* `speaker play example.dfpwm left` plays the "example.dfpwm" audio file using the speaker on the left of the computer.
* `speaker stop` stops any currently playing audio.
