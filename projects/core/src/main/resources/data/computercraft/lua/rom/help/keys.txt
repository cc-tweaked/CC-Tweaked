The keys API contains constants for all the key codes that can be returned by the "key" event:

Example usage:
local sEvent, nKey = os.pullEvent()
if sEvent == "key" and nKey == keys.enter then
   -- Do something
end

See https://www.minecraft.wiki/w/Key_codes, or the source code, for a complete reference.
