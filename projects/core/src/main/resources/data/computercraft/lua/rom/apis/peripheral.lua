--[[- Find and control peripherals attached to this computer.

Peripherals are blocks (or turtle and pocket computer upgrades) which can
be controlled by a computer. For instance, the @{speaker} peripheral allows a
computer to play music and the @{monitor} peripheral allows you to display text
in the world.

## Referencing peripherals

Computers can interact with adjacent peripherals. Each peripheral is given a
name based on which direction it is in. For instance, a disk drive below your
computer will be called `"bottom"` in your Lua code, one to the left called
`"left"` , and so on for all 6 directions (`"bottom"`, `"top"`, `"left"`,
`"right"`, `"front"`, `"back"`).

You can list the names of all peripherals with the `peripherals` program, or the
@{peripheral.getNames} function.

It's also possible to use peripherals which are further away from your computer
through the use of @{modem|Wired Modems}. Place one modem against your computer
(you may need to sneak and right click), run Networking Cable to your
peripheral, and then place another modem against that block. You can then right
click the modem to use (or *attach*) the peripheral. This will print a
peripheral name to chat, which can then be used just like a direction name to
access the peripheral. You can click on the message to copy the name to your
clipboard.

## Using peripherals

Once you have the name of a peripheral, you can call functions on it using the
@{peripheral.call} function. This takes the name of our peripheral, the name of
the function we want to call, and then its arguments.

:::info
Some bits of the peripheral API call peripheral functions *methods* instead
(for example, the @{peripheral.getMethods} function). Don't worry, they're the
same thing!
:::

Let's say we have a monitor above our computer (and so "top") and want to
@{monitor.write|write some text to it}. We'd write the following:

```lua
peripheral.call("top", "write", "This is displayed on a monitor!")
```

Once you start calling making a couple of peripheral calls this can get very
repetitive, and so we can @{peripheral.wrap|wrap} a peripheral. This builds a
table of all the peripheral's functions so you can use it like an API or module.

For instance, we could have written the above example as follows:

```lua
local my_monitor = peripheral.wrap("top")
my_monitor.write("This is displayed on a monitor!")
```

## Finding peripherals

Sometimes when you're writing a program you don't care what a peripheral is
called, you just need to know it's there. For instance, if you're writing a
music player, you just need a speaker - it doesn't matter if it's above or below
the computer.

Thankfully there's a quick way to do this: @{peripheral.find}. This takes a
*peripheral type* and returns all the attached peripherals which are of this
type.

What is a peripheral type though? This is a string which describes what a
peripheral is, and so what functions are available on it. For instance, speakers
are just called `"speaker"`, and monitors `"monitor"`. Some peripherals might
have more than one type - a Minecraft chest is both a `"minecraft:chest"` and
`"inventory"`.

You can get all the types a peripheral has with @{peripheral.getType}, and check
a peripheral is a specific type with @{peripheral.hasType}.

To return to our original example, let's use @{peripheral.find} to find an
attached speaker:

```lua
local speaker = peripheral.find("speaker")
speaker.playNote("harp")
```

@module peripheral
@see event!peripheral This event is fired whenever a new peripheral is attached.
@see event!peripheral_detach This event is fired whenever a peripheral is detached.
@since 1.3
@changed 1.51 Add support for wired modems.
