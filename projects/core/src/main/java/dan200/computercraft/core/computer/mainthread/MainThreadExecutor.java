/**
 * Keeps track of tasks that a {@link Computer} should run on the main thread and how long that has been spent executing
 * them.
 * <p>
 * This provides rate-limiting mechanism for tasks enqueued with {@link Computer#queueMainThread(Runnable)}, but also
 * those run elsewhere (such as during the turtle's tick). In order to handle this, the executor goes through three
 * stages:
 * <p>
 * When {@link State#COOL}, the computer is allocated {@link CoreConfig#maxMainComputerTime}ns to execute any work
 * this tick. At the beginning of the tick, we execute as many {@link MainThread} tasks as possible, until our
 * time-frame or the global time frame has expired.
 * <p>
 * Then, when other objects (such as block entities or entities) are ticked, we update how much time we've used via
 * {@link WorkMonitor#trackWork(long, TimeUnit)}.
 * <p>
 * Now, if anywhere during this period, we use more than our allocated time slice, the executor is marked as
 * {@link State#HOT}. This means it will no longer be able to execute {@link MainThread} tasks (though will still
 * execute tile entity tasks, in order to prevent the main thread from exhausting work every tick).
 * <p>
 * At the beginning of the next tick, we increment the budget e by {@link CoreConfig#maxMainComputerTime} and any
 * {@link State#HOT} executors are marked as {@link State#COOLING}. They will remain cooling until their budget is fully
 * replenished (is equal to {@link CoreConfig#maxMainComputerTime}). Note, this is different to {@link MainThread},
 * which allows running when it has any budget left. When cooling, <em>no</em> tasks are executed - be they on the tile
 * entity or main thread.
 * <p>
 * This mechanism means that, on average, computers will use at most {@link CoreConfig#maxMainComputerTime}ns per
 * second, but one task source will not prevent others from executing.
 *

 * @see WorkMonitor
