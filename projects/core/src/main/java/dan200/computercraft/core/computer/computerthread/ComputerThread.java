/**
 * Runs all scheduled tasks for computers in a {@link ComputerContext}.
 * <p>
 * This acts as an over-complicated {@link ThreadPoolExecutor}: It creates several {@linkplain WorkerThread worker
 * threads} which pull tasks from a shared queue, executing them. It also creates a single {@link Monitor} thread, which
 * updates computer timeouts, killing workers if they have not been terminated by {@link TimeoutState#isSoftAborted()}.
 * <p>
 * Computers are executed using a priority system, with those who have spent less time executing having a higher
 * priority than those hogging the thread. This, combined with {@link TimeoutState#isPaused()} means we can reduce the
 * risk of badly behaved computers stalling execution for everyone else.
 * <p>
 * This is done using an implementation of Linux's Completely Fair Scheduler. When a computer executes, we compute what
 * share of execution time it has used (time executed/number of tasks). We then pick the computer who has the least
 * "virtual execution time" (aka {@link ExecutorImpl#virtualRuntime}).
 * <p>
 * When adding a computer to the queue, we make sure its "virtual runtime" is at least as big as the smallest runtime.
 * This means that adding computers which have slept a lot do not then have massive priority over everyone else. See
 * {@link #queue(ExecutorImpl)} for how this is implemented.
 * <p>
 * In reality, it's unlikely that more than a few computers are waiting to execute at once, so this will not have much
 * effect unless you have a computer hogging execution time. However, it is pretty effective in those situations.
