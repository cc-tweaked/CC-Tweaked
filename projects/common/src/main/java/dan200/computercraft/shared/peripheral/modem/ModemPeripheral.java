/**
 * Modems allow you to send messages between computers over long distances.
 * <p>
 * :::tip
 * Modems provide a fairly basic set of methods, which makes them very flexible but often hard to work with. The
 * {@literal @}{rednet} API is built on top of modems, and provides a more user-friendly interface.
 * :::
 * <p>
 * ## Sending and receiving messages
 * Modems operate on a series of channels, a bit like frequencies on a radio. Any modem can send a message on a
 * particular channel, but only those which have {@link #open opened} the channel and are "listening in" can receive
 * messages.
 * <p>
 * Channels are represented as an integer between 0 and 65535 inclusive. These channels don't have any defined meaning,
 * though some APIs or programs will assign a meaning to them. For instance, the @{gps} module sends all its messages on
 * channel 65534 (@{gps.CHANNEL_GPS}), while @{rednet} uses channels equal to the computer's ID.
 * <p>
 * - Sending messages is done with the {@link #transmit(int, int, Object)} message.
 * - Receiving messages is done by listening to the @{modem_message} event.
 * <p>
 * ## Types of modem
 * CC: Tweaked comes with three kinds of modem, with different capabilities.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Wireless modems:</strong> Wireless modems can send messages to any other wireless modem. They can be placed next to a
 * computer, or equipped as a pocket computer or turtle upgrade.
 * <p>
 * Wireless modems have a limited range, only sending messages to modems within 64 blocks. This range increases
 * linearly once the modem is above y=96, to a maximum of 384 at world height.</li>
 * <li><strong>Ender modems:</strong> These are upgraded versions of normal wireless modems. They do not have a distance
 * limit, and can send messages between dimensions.</li>
 * <li><strong>Wired modems:</strong> These send messages to other any other wired modems connected to the same network
 * (using <em>Networking Cable</em>). They also can be used to attach additional peripherals to a computer.</li></ul>
 *
 * @cc.module modem
 * @cc.see modem_message Queued when a modem receives a message on an {@link #open(int) open channel}.
 * @cc.see rednet A networking API built on top of the modem peripheral.
 * @cc.usage Wrap a modem and a message on channel 15, requesting a response on channel 43. Then wait for a message to
 * arrive on channel 43 and print it.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * local modem = peripheral.find("modem") or error("No modem attached", 0)
 * modem.open(43) -- Open 43 so we can receive replies
 *
 * -- Send our message
 * modem.transmit(15, 43, "Hello, world!")
 *
 * -- And wait for a reply
 * local event, side, channel, replyChannel, message, distance
 * repeat
 *   event, side, channel, replyChannel, message, distance = os.pullEvent("modem_message")
 * until channel == 43
 *
 * print("Received a reply: " .. tostring(message))
 * }</pre>
