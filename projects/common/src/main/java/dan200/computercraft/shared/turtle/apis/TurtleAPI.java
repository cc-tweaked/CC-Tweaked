/**
 * Turtles are a robotic device, which can break and place blocks, attack mobs, and move about the world. They have
 * an internal inventory of 16 slots, allowing them to store blocks they have broken or would like to place.
 * <p>
 * ## Movement
 * Turtles are capable of moving through the world. As turtles are blocks themselves, they are confined to Minecraft's
 * grid, moving a single block at a time.
 * <p>
 * {@literal @}{turtle.forward} and @{turtle.back} move the turtle in the direction it is facing, while @{turtle.up} and
 * {@literal @}{turtle.down} move it up and down (as one might expect!). In order to move left or right, you first need
 * to turn the turtle using @{turtle.turnLeft}/@{turtle.turnRight} and then move forward or backwards.
 * <p>
 * :::info
 * The name "turtle" comes from [Turtle graphics], which originated from the Logo programming language. Here you'd move
 * a turtle with various commands like "move 10" and "turn left", much like ComputerCraft's turtles!
 * :::
 * <p>
 * Moving a turtle (though not turning it) consumes *fuel*. If a turtle does not have any @{turtle.refuel|fuel}, it
 * won't move, and the movement functions will return @{false}. If your turtle isn't going anywhere, the first thing to
 * check is if you've fuelled your turtle.
 * <p>
 * :::tip Handling errors
 * Many turtle functions can fail in various ways. For instance, a turtle cannot move forward if there's already a block
 * there. Instead of erroring, functions which can fail either return @{true} if they succeed, or @{false} and some
 * error message if they fail.
 * <p>
 * Unexpected failures can often lead to strange behaviour. It's often a good idea to check the return values of these
 * functions, or wrap them in @{assert} (for instance, use `assert(turtle.forward())` rather than `turtle.forward()`),
 * so the program doesn't misbehave.
 * :::
 * <p>
 * ## Turtle upgrades
 * While a normal turtle can move about the world and place blocks, its functionality is limited. Thankfully, turtles
 * can be upgraded with *tools* and @{peripheral|peripherals}. Turtles have two upgrade slots, one on the left and right
 * sides. Upgrades can be equipped by crafting a turtle with the upgrade, or calling the @{turtle.equipLeft}/@{turtle.equipRight}
 * functions.
 * <p>
 * Turtle tools allow you to break blocks (@{turtle.dig}) and attack entities (@{turtle.attack}). Some tools are more
 * suitable to a task than others. For instance, a diamond pickaxe can break every block, while a sword does more
 * damage. Other tools have more niche use-cases, for instance hoes can til dirt.
 * <p>
 * Peripherals (such as the @{modem|wireless modem} or @{speaker}) can also be equipped as upgrades. These are then
 * accessible by accessing the `"left"` or `"right"` peripheral.
