/**
 * A generic source of {@link LuaMethod} functions.
 *
 * Unlike normal objects ({@link IDynamicLuaObject} or {@link IPeripheral}), methods do not target this object but
 * instead are defined as {@code static} and accept their target as the first parameter. This allows you to inject
 * methods onto objects you do not own, as well as declaring methods for a specific "trait" (for instance, a
 * {@link Capability}).
 *
 * Currently the "generic peripheral" system is incompatible with normal peripherals. Normal {@link IPeripheralProvider}
 * or {@link IPeripheral} implementations take priority. Tile entities which use this system are given a peripheral name
 * determined by their id, rather than any peripheral provider. This will hopefully change in the future, once a suitable
 * design has been established.
 *
 * For example, the main CC: Tweaked mod defines a generic source for inventories, which works on {@link IItemHandler}s:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class InventoryMethods implements GenericSource {
 *     \@LuaFunction( mainThread = true )
 *     public static int size(IItemHandler inventory) {
 *         return inventory.getSlots();
 *     }
 *
 *     // ...
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see ComputerCraftAPI#registerGenericSource(GenericSource)
 * @see ComputerCraftAPI#registerGenericCapability(Capability) New capabilities (those not built into Forge) must be
 * explicitly given to the generic peripheral system, as there is no way to enumerate all capabilities.
