/**
 * Wired nodes act as a layer between {@link IWiredElement}s and {@link IWiredNetwork}s.
 *
 * Firstly, a node acts as a packet network, capable of sending and receiving modem messages to connected nodes. These
 * methods may be safely used on any thread.
 *
 * When sending a packet, the system will attempt to find the shortest path between the two nodes based on their
 * element's position. Note that packet senders and receivers can have different locations from their associated
 * element: the distance between the two will be added to the total packet's distance.
 *
 * Wired nodes also provide several convenience methods for interacting with a wired network. These should only ever
 * be used on the main server thread.
