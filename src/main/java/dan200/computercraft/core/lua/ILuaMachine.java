 * but you'd need a way to provide alternative ROMs, BIOSes, etc...

 * external mod authors are interested in registering their own machines, we can look into how we can provide some
 * mechanism for registering these.
 *
 * This should provide implementations of {@link dan200.computercraft.api.lua.ILuaContext}, and the ability to convert
 * {@link IDynamicLuaObject}s into something the VM understands, as well as handling method calls.
