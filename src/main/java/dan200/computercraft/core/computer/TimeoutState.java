/**
 * Used to measure how long a computer has executed for, and thus the relevant timeout states.
 *
 * Timeouts are mostly used for execution of Lua code: we should ideally never have a state where constructing the APIs
 * or machines themselves takes more than a fraction of a second.
 *
 * When a computer runs, it is allowed to run for 7 seconds ({@link #TIMEOUT}). After that point, the "soft abort" flag
 * is set ({@link #isSoftAborted()}). Here, the Lua machine will attempt to abort the program in some safe manner
 * (namely, throwing a "Too long without yielding" error).
 *
 * Now, if a computer still does not stop after that period, they're behaving really badly. 1.5 seconds after a soft
 * abort ({@link #ABORT_TIMEOUT}), we trigger a hard abort (note, this is done from the computer thread manager). This
 * will destroy the entire Lua runtime and shut the computer down.
 *
 * The Lua runtime is also allowed to pause execution if there are other computers contesting for work. All computers
 * are allowed to run for {@link ComputerThread#scaledPeriod()} nanoseconds (see {@link #currentDeadline}). After that
 * period, if any computers are waiting to be executed then we'll set the paused flag to true ({@link #isPaused()}.
 *
 * @see ComputerThread
 * @see ILuaMachine
 * @see MachineResult#isPause()
