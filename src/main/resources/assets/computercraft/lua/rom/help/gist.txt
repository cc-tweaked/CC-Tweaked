Gist is a service provided by GitHub that allows uploading small sets of text files, similar to Pastebin.
The gist program lets you upload and download files through this service.
The HTTP API must be enabled in ComputerCraft.cfg to use this program.
The first time you upload a file to Gist, you will be prompted to enter a Personal Access Key (PAK).
Follow the instructions at https://tinyurl.com/GitHubPAK to generate one. Make sure to check the 'gist' checkbox on step 7 (below 'Select scopes').
This PAK will be stored in your settings as "gist.id" for future use.

Advantages of Gist over Pastebin:
* Hosted by GitHub, meaning more reliable service
* Multiple files can be uploaded at once
* Descriptions can tell people what your files do
* Markdown & automatic syntax hightlighting online
* Files can be edited after uploading
* Tied to your GitHub account

Disadvantages of Gist:
* Requires you to log in to upload files
* Longer IDs mean more typing or pasting

Usages:
gist put <filenames...> [-- description...]
gist edit <id> <filenames...> [-- description...]
gist delete <id>
gist get <id> <filename>
gist run <id> [arguments...]
gist info <id>

An ID consists of a 32-character hash (last part of a gist.github.com URL), and optionally a slash ('/') followed by a file name.
A specific revision can be selected by following the hash with a colon (':') and the revision SHA hash. (Advanced users only)
If no file name is provided, it will try to find the most suitable file to download with this algorithm:
* If a file name is specified, retrieves that file
* Otherwise, if there's only one file, retrieves that file
* Otherwise, if there's a file named 'init.lua', retrieves 'init.lua'
* Otherwise, if there's more than one file but only one *.lua file, retrieves the Lua file
* Otherwise, retrieves the first Lua file alphabetically (with a warning)
* Otherwise, you'll need to manually give it a file name

When using the edit subcommand, you can delete files by deleting them on disk, then uploading the non-existent file.
For example, if you want to delete "bar.lua" from your Gist, first delete "bar.lua" on the computer, then run "gist edit <id> bar.lua".
You can also add or replace files by listing those files as well.
Only files you specify will be changed: files you don't list won't be edited or deleted.
Also, do not specify a file name in the ID when using edit.

Do not specify a file name or revision hash when using the delete subcommand.

Examples:
"gist put foo.lua" will upload the file "foo.lua" to gist.github.com, and prints the URL.
"gist put foo.lua bar.lua -- My cool program" will upload the files "foo.lua" and "bar.lua" to gist.github.com with the description "My cool program", and prints the URL.
"gist edit 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef foo.lua -- My cool program - Updated!" will update "foo.lua" at https://gist.github.com/0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef to have the contents of "foo.lua", changing the description to "My cool program - Updated!". If "foo.lua" doesn't exist, it will be deleted from the Gist.
"gist delete 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef" will delete https://gist.github.com/0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef.
"gist get 42bc69d3757226c966da752df80437dc foo.lua" will download the first Lua file from the URL https://gist.github.com/42bc69d3757226c966da752df80437dc, and saves it as "foo.lua".
"gist get b7ded5a4b2a221e13dd3492f2971ae34/ipsw_keys.py ipsw_keys.py" will download the file "ipsw_keys.py" from the URL https://gist.github.com/b7ded5a4b2a221e13dd3492f2971ae34, and saves it as "ipsw_keys.py".
"gist run b5e069cdf65c1174f24fc113c0e1292b" will download the first Lua file from https://gist.github.com/b5e069cdf65c1174f24fc113c0e1292b, and immediately runs it.
"gist info 497a5658c24e02aff4e4fab743f8adc7" will show a description and file list from https://gist.github.com/497a5658c24e02aff4e4fab743f8adc7.
