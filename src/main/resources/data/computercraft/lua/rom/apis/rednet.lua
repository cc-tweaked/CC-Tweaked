--[[- The Rednet API allows computers to communicate between each other by using
@{modem|modems}. It provides a layer of abstraction on top of the main @{modem}
peripheral, making it slightly easier to use.

## Basic usage
In order to send a message between two computers, each computer must have a
modem on one of its sides (or in the case of pocket computers and turtles, the
modem must be equipped as an upgrade). The two computers should then call
@{rednet.open}, which sets up the modems ready to send and receive messages.

Once rednet is opened, you can send messages using @{rednet.send} and receive
them using @{rednet.receive}. It's also possible to send a message to _every_
rednet-using computer using @{rednet.broadcast}.

:::caution Network security

While rednet provides a friendly way to send messages to specific computers, it
doesn't provide any guarantees about security. Other computers could be
listening in to your messages, or even pretending to send messages from other computers!

If you're playing on a multi-player server (or at least one where you don't
trust other players), it's worth encrypting or signing your rednet messages.
:::

## Protocols and hostnames
Several rednet messages accept "protocol"s - simple string names describing what
a message is about. When sending messages using @{rednet.send} and
@{rednet.broadcast}, you can optionally specify a protocol for the message. This
same protocol can then be given to @{rednet.receive}, to ignore all messages not
using this protocol.

It's also possible to look-up computers based on protocols, providing a basic
system for service discovery and [DNS]. A computer can advertise that it
supports a particular protocol with @{rednet.host}, also providing a friendly
"hostname". Other computers may then find all computers which support this
protocol using @{rednet.lookup}.
