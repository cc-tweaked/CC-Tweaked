New features in CC: Tweaked 1.87.0

* Add documentation to many Lua functions. This is published online at https://tweaked.cc/.
* Replace to pretty-printer in the Lua REPL. It now supports displaying functions and recursive tables. This printer is may be used within your own code through the `cc.pretty` module.
* Add `fs.getCapacity`. A complement to `fs.getFreeSpace`, this returns the capacity of the supplied drive.
* Add `fs.getAttributes`. This provides file size and type, as well as creation and modification time.
* Update Cobalt version. This backports several features from Lua 5.2 and 5.3:
  - The `__len` metamethod may now be used by tables.
  - Add `\z`, hexadecimal (`\x00`) and unicode (`\u0000`) string escape codes.
  - Add `utf8` lib.
  - Mirror Lua's behaviour of tail calls more closely. Native functions are no longer tail called, and tail calls are displayed in the stack trace.
  - `table.unpack` now uses `__len` and `__index` metamethods.
  - Parser errors now include the token where the error occured.
* Add `textutils.unserializeJSON`. This can be used to decode standard JSON and stringified-NBT.
* Switch the monitor renderer to use VBOs, providing a _significant_ performance boost in some cases. You can switch back to the display list renderer via the config.
* The `settings` API now allows "defining" settings. This allows settings to specify a default value and description.
* Enable the motd on non-pocket computers.
* Allow using the menu with the mouse in edit and paint (JakobDev).
* Add Danish and Korean translations (ChristianLW, mindy15963)
* Fire `mouse_up` events in the monitor program.
* Allow specifying a timeout to `websocket.receive`.
* Increase the maximimum limit for websocket messages.
* Optimise capacity checking of computer/disk folders.

And several bug fixes:
* Fix turtle texture being incorrectly oriented (magiczocker10).
* Prevent copying folders into themselves.
* Normalise file paths within shell.setDir (JakobDev)
* Fix turtles treating waterlogged blocks as water.
* Register an entity renderer for the turtle's fake player.
