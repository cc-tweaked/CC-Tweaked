The speaker program plays audio files using speakers attached to this computer.
It supports audio files in either WAV or DFPWM format.
To convert music into DFPWM, see https://music.madefor.cc.
The speaker program only supports WAV files using 8-bit PCM or DFPWM.
WAV files that have more than one channel or a sample rate other than 48000 Hz will not play correctly.

## Examples:
- `speaker play example.dfpwm left` plays the "example.dfpwm" audio file using the speaker on the left of the computer.
- `speaker stop` stops any currently playing audio.
