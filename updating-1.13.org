* Remaining changes [6/15]
** TODO [#A] ClientRegistry
   - Turtle model
   - loadModel

** TODO [#B] Turtle/pocket computer upgrades recipes and advancements
   Can we auto-generate these in a folder?

** =/computercraft= command [0/4]
*** TODO [#B] Client side commands
    We may need to PR into Forge

*** TODO [#C] Main command documentation
    It'd be nice to have a better documentation system. Our current "described literal node" implementation will never
    work without MC support.

*** TODO [#B] Look into threading of the computer commands
    Are these run on the main thread? If so, we don't need to do any of that copying stuff.

*** TODO [#C] Document our arguments + argument builders a little more
    It'd be nice to have some rationale for what each one does, why we return suppliers instead, etc...

** DONE [#C] Revert our writeDescription returning an =NBTTagCompound= change.
   Similarly, go through places where the diff is unreasonably noisy for silly reasons (such as changing method
   orders). This is especially obvious in =TileGeneric= and =BlockGeneric=.

   Maybe also look into where we've done =m_= removals and =ID= → =Id=. Though at the same time, uppercase naming here
   is dumb.

** TODO [#B] Command block API
   How do we integrate command listings with this?

** DONE [#A] Decide on an NBT convention
   Do we do =PascalCase=, =camelCase= or =snake_case= for fields? We need to decide this soon, while we're still able to
   break compat.

   Minecraft seems to use =PascalCase=, but I don't think we need to follow that.

   *Update:* We've gone with =PascalCase= for all the persisted NBT fields.

** TODO [#A] Cable neighbour updates
   Namely, how do we interact with updatePostPlacement.

** DONE [#A] Post placement of computers fires updates

** TODO [#C] Move to =BlockContainer=
   Means we no longer have to implement =ITileEntityProvider= or all that jazz.

** DONE [#B] Tags for =ColourUtils=

** DONE [#C] Fix issues with the naming process
   - Computer and monitor recipes not being renamed
   - Language file being part of the renaming change.

** TODO [#A] Clear =ClientComputerRegistry= on disconnect

** TODO [#A] Check our usage of (inventory) capabilities

** TODO [#B] =doesSneakBypassUse=
   What does this do, and why do we need it?

   I assume it's to allow shift-sneaking disks into drives.

** TODO [#C] Convert to Forge's container system
   Also simplify our current implementation.

** DONE [#A] Waterlogging
   For modems, cables and turtles. This is a high priority, as we need it before
   anything else to ensure we don't break worlds.

    - [X] Add waterlogging to blockstates
    - [X] Test placement of waterlogged blocks into water
    - [X] Test turtle movement in water

** DONE [#B] Disk colours are entirely broken

* Testing [0/5]

** TODO [#A] Breaking blocks
   Especially peripherals - we need to ensure we break them in the correct order, otherwise we'll be trying to read the
   block state when its no longer there!

** TODO [#B] Redstone (and peripheral) connectivity
   Is this behaviour consistent with what was on 1.12?

** TODO [#A] Command computer permissions

** TODO [#C] Are we drawing in the right GUI method?

** TODO [#A] Run on a server
   We're totally using some client-only methods some place.
** TODO [#B] Handling of dyes
   Printers are currently broken.
