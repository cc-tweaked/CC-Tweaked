The @{modem_message} event is fired when a message is received on an open channel on any @{modem}.

## Return Values
1. @{string}: The event name.
2. @{string}: The side of the modem that received the message.
3. @{number}: The channel that the message was sent on.
4. @{number}: The reply channel set by the sender.
5. @{any}: The message as sent by the sender.
6. <span class="type">@{number}|@{nil}</span>: The distance between the sender and the receiver in blocks, or @{nil} if the message was sent between dimensions.

## Example
Wraps a @{modem} peripheral, opens channel 0 for listening, and prints all received messages.

```lua
local modem = peripheral.find("modem") or error("No modem attached", 0)
modem.open(0)

while true do
    local event, side, channel, replyChannel, message, distance = os.pullEvent("modem_message")
    print(("Message received on side %s on channel %d (reply to %d) from %f blocks away with message %s"):format(
        side, channel, replyChannel, distance, tostring(message)
    ))
end
```
