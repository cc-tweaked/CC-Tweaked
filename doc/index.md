# ![CC: Tweaked](logo.png)
CC: Tweaked is a mod for Minecraft which adds programmable computers, turtles and more to the game. A fork of the
much-beloved [ComputerCraft], it continues its legacy with improved performance and stability, along with a wealth of
new features.

CC: Tweaked can be installed from [CurseForge] or [Modrinth]. It runs on both [Minecraft Forge] and [Fabric].

## Features
Controlled using the [Lua programming language][lua], CC: Tweaked's computers provides all the tools you need to start
writing code and automating your Minecraft world.

While computers are incredibly powerful, they're rather limited by their inability to move about. *Turtles* are the
solution here. They can move about the world, placing and breaking blocks, swinging a sword to protect you from zombies,
or whatever else you program them to!

Not all problems can be solved with a pickaxe though, and so CC: Tweaked also provides a bunch of additional peripherals
for your computers. You can play a tune with speakers, display text or images on a monitor, connect all your
computers together with modems, and much more.

Computers can now also interact with inventories such as chests, allowing you to build complex inventory and item
management systems.

## Getting Started
While ComputerCraft is lovely for both experienced programmers and for people who have never coded before, it can be a
little daunting getting started. Thankfully, there's several fantastic tutorials out there:

 - [Direwolf20's ComputerCraft tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUHUhfCY5A "ComputerCraft Tutorial Episode 1 - HELP! and Hello World")
 - [Sethbling's ComputerCraft series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSsx4VSe-Uk "Programming Tutorial with Minecraft Turtles -- Ep. 1: Intro to Turtles and If-Then-Else_End")
 - [Lyqyd's Computer Basics 1](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/15033-computer-basics-i/ "Computer Basics I")

Once you're a little more familiar with the mod, the sidebar and links below provide more detailed documentation on the
various APIs and peripherals provided by the mod.
